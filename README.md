## Projects
- ### Currently Working on: 
  - [NBA Player Acquisition Recommendations](https://github.com/chrisnish4/nba_player_acquisition_recommendation): The goal of this project is to isolate areas of the game where certain teams are lacking and recommend players that can help fill in their gaps. My plan for this project is to train a classifier on data from the 2014-2015 onward (Steph Curry Era) to identify teams that are able to make it to the second round of playoffs. After the classifier is trained and optimized I will input the team statistics from the current (2021-2022) season to determine if they are second round ready. Next I will cluster players using dimensionality reduction inspired by [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+player+clustering&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS892US892&oq=nba+player+clustering&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39l2j46i67i131i433j69i60l4.2464j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) article, to group players into archetypes. Finally I will match current teams that were predicted to not make it to the second round and recommend the players that most fit their needs. I am currently optimizing the classifier to predict if a team will make it to the second round.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualizations 
  - [Ethereum NFT EDA](https://github.com/chrisnish4/ethereum_NFT_EDA): Analysis of minting and transfer data of NFTs create on the Ethereum blockchain. Sought to find NFT projects with most rapidly increasing prices, found evidence of artificial price inflation.

- ### Algorithms from Scratch
  - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/chrisnish4/linear_regression_scratch): The purpose of this notebook was to better my understanding of linear regression. I compared three different methods of linear regression: line of best fit equations, closed form derivatives, and gradient descent. I found that I was able to derive the line of best fit equations from the closed form optimization of the sum of squared errors derivative. I also found that optimizing with gradient descent resulted in the same parameter values as the two prior methods.
  - [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/chrisnish4/knn_scratch): I wanted to solidify my understanding of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, so I created my own and compared the results to teh Sci-kit Learn KNeighborsClassifier on a simplified version of the Iris dataset. 
  - [Perceptron](https://github.com/chrisnish4/perceptron): Coded a perceptron from scratch to use on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. I was able to achieve a high level of accuracy, precision, and recall, however my scores would vary greatly depending on the value of the bias term. I plotted the bias term against the accuracy score it would produce to find the best value.
  - Want to do polynomial regression, logisitc regression, decision trees, kmeans, GMM, PCA in the future.

- ### Classification 
  - [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/chrisnish4/breast_cancer_pred): Comparing three different classification algorithms on breast cancer prediction dataset. Focused on recall/sensitivity as primary performance metric and tried to maximize recall/sensitivity. 
  - [Empirical Comparison of Binary Classifiers](https://github.com/chrisnish4/Empirical-Comparison-Supervised-Learning-): Performed binary classification using three algorithms (logistic regression, k nearest neighbor, and random forest) on three separate classification problems. I used accuracy score to evalute each of the methods. For two out of the three classification problems, the random forest algorithm performed the best. For the hand writing recognition task, k-nearest neighbors out performed the other models. Going forward, I would utilize more error metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score and more diverse classification problems to highlight the importance in choosing an error metric that suits the problem at hand. 

- ### Clustering
  - [Police Stop Clustering](https://github.com/chrisnish4/Police_Stop_EDA): Performed various clustering algorithms (K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model) on police stop data.
